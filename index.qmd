# **Welcome** {.unnumbered}

Hello!

Welcome to this website that accompanies the [2023 Summer Institute in Modeling for Infectious Diseases (SISMID) Module 2: Mathematical Models of Infectious Diseases](https://si.biostat.washington.edu/suminst/archives/SISMID2023/MD2302).
This website contains both the lecture notes, so you can refer back to them at a later date, and the exercises that we will be completing throughout the module.



## Workshop Pre-Requisites

As there is a reasonable amount of material to cover, and a relatively short amount of time to cover it in, there are some pre-requisite tasks to get set up ahead of the workshop.

Firstly, this workshop requires some prior understanding of the R programming languages, as well as a working installation of R.
If you do not have any experience, please refer to the [Installing R](install-r.qmd) and [The Basics of R](basics-of-r.qmd) pages of the Pre-Requisites section.
Everyone should refer to the [R Packages](install-r.qmd#r-packages) section in the [Installing R](install-r.qmd) page to ensure you have the neccessary packages installed for the exercises.

It is also highly recommended that you read the [Setting Up A Project](project-management.qmd) page for how to structure your code as you go through the exercises: we provide some guidelines to make your code easier to understand and navigate, both for yourself, and for others.

Please set aside about an hour to go through these materials and get set up.
You should be able to do this in about 15 minutes if you are already experienced with R, but as with all things computational, it's worth including some buffer time in case you run into issues.
If you are completely new to R, this could take an hour or so, but is certainly worth the time investment: it will be hard to follow some of the exercises if you do not understand what the code is doing.

## Keywords, Code, and Other Formatting

Throughout the book, you'll see some keywords, code, and other points that I'll try to delineate with the following formatting:

::: {.callout-note}
This will be a note, and will be used to highlight important points, or to provide additional information.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="SET"}
This will be an instruction to set certain parameters or values in the R code, or for the interactive plots.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Instruction" appearance="minimal"}
This will be a general instruction.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
This will be used to highlight a useful tip.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
This will provide a warning that you may get an unexpected result if you're not careful.
:::

It is worth noting that some of these callouts may be collapsible.
You can tell a callout is collapsible if there is a little `>` or `⋁` in the top right corner of the callout i.e.,

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
This is an example of a collapsible callout that defaults to being collapsed.
:::

- `code` will be used to highlight code.
- `{package::function()}` will be used to denote a specific package and function, e.g., `{dplyr::mutate()}` denotes the `mutate()` function from the `{dplyr}` package.
    - Often the `function()` will be listed without the package, as there are `library()` calls at the top of each page indicating the packages used in that page, and the majority of functions will not cause conflicts, i.e., there are not packages with functions of the same name.
- **Bold** will be used to highlight keywords and phrases, e.g., **Git** or **GitHub**.
    - **Bold** will also be highlighted in this way, e.g., **commits** or **pushed** being the result of the code `git commit` or `git push` 
- ***Bold-italics*** will be used to highlight file names, e.g., ***README.md*** or ***LICENSE***.
- *Italics* will be used for emphasis in certain circumstances, e.g., signifying a question from an interactive terminal command.

Dr. Matinez is the Director of Environmental Health at WE ACT for Environmental Justice.

Dr. Martinez earned her Ph.D. in Ecology & Evolution in 2015 at the University of Michigan, and did her postdoctoral training at Princeton University.
Before joining WE ACT, she served as an Assistant Professor at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, followed by Emory University, in the Dept. of Biology.
Since 2017, Dr. Martinez has been supported by the prestigious NIH Director’s Early Independence Award.
Over the past decade, her research has focused on infectious disease ecology, climate change, maternal and infant health, social justice, and environmental impacts on health (including biological rhythms).
